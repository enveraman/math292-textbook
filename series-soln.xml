                <title>Why are these defined as they are?</title>
                
                <p>
                    We can solve equations of the form <m>x^2 y''' + ax y' + by = 0</m> pretty easily when we set <m>y = x^r</m> (these are Cauchy-Euler ODEs).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, we want to solve equations of the form <m>P(x) y'' + Q(x) y' + R(x) y = 0</m>. By dividing out by <m>P(x)</m>, we can transform this into the equation <m>y'' + q(x) y' + r(x)y = 0</m> where
                </p>

                <md>
                    <mrow>q(x) = \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \qquad \text{and} \qquad r(x) = \frac{R(x)}{P(x)}.</mrow>
                </md>

                <p>
                    To try to kinda match the Cauchy-Euler ODE form, multiply both sides of <m>y'' + q(x) y' + r(x) y = 0</m> by <m>x^2</m> to get
                </p>

                <md>
                    <mrow>x^2 y'' + x^2 q(x) y' + x^2 r(x) y = 0.</mrow>
                </md>

                <p>
                    Then, to further match the form of the constants in the Cauchy-Euler ODEs, group the coefficients like this:
                </p>

                <md>
                    <mrow>x^2 y'' + [x q(x)] xy' + [x^2r(x)] y = 0.</mrow>
                </md>

                <p>
                    This way, if <m>xq(x) = a</m> and <m>x^2r(x) = b</m>, then we'd easily get back to a Cauchy-Euler ODE. More realistically, you'd want <m>xq(x)</m> and <m>x^2r(x)</m> to be representable as a power series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, say we set <m>xq(x)</m> equal to
                </p>

                <md>
                    <mrow>xq(x) \amp = q_0 + q_1 x + q_2 x^2 + \cdots + q_nx^n + \cdots.</mrow>
                </md>

                <p>
                    Then, when we evaluate <m>xq(x)</m> at <m>x = 0</m>, we get the <em>importantly finite</em> value <m>q_0</m>. This corresponds to saying that the limit
                </p>

                <md>
                    <mrow>\lim_{x \to 0} xq(x)</mrow>
                </md>

                <p>
                    is finite and equal to <m>q_0</m>. A similar thing happens with <m>x^2r(x)</m>.

                <title>Find the regular singular points of the ODE <m>x^2 y'' + x y' + x^2 y = 0</m>.</title>
                
                <p>
                    Matching this up with <m>P(x) y'' + Q(x) y' + R(x) y = 0</m>, we see that <m>P(x) = x^2</m>, <m>Q(x) = x</m>, and <m>R(x) = x^2</m>. Note that all of these are (technically) power series in <m>x</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, we find the singular points of the ODE, which starts by setting <m>P(x) = x^2 = 0</m>. Thus, the only possible singular point is <m>x = 0</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, we check if <m>x = 0</m> is regular. As in the method, define <m>q(x) = Q(x)/P(x) = x/x^2 = 1/x</m> and <m>r(x) = R(x)/P(x) = x^2/x^2 = 1</m>. Then, we'll compute the following limits:

                </md>

                <p>
                    Since <em>both</em> of these limits are finite, <m>x = 0</m> is a regular singular point.

                    Try this one yourself! We have <m>P(x) = (x-1)^2 (x+1)</m>, <m>Q(x) = x</m>, and <m>R(x) = x-1</m> in this case.

            <p>
                The method is simple enough to remember. Say we want to solve the ODE
            </p>

            <md>
                <mrow>P(x)y'' + Q(x)y' + R(x)y = 0,</mrow>

                After you substitute this form in, condense all the terms and find a <q>recurrence relation</q> for <m>a_n</m>. We'll see an example of this in the examples.

                    The first thing we do is set

                    We can differentiate this like we would for any polynomial:

                    <mrow>y'(x) \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty na_n x^{n-1}, \qquad y''(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2}.</mrow>

                <p>
                    (Technically, <m>y'</m> should start with <m>n=1</m> and <m>y''</m> should start with <m>n=2</m> but that shouldn't matter all too much.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    And now, we substitute these into our ODE <m>y'' + 2xy' + y = 0</m>:

                <p>
                    We want to combine all the sums so that there's only one summation. To combine the two sums above, we need to use an <q>index shift</q> on the sum
                    
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2}</mrow>
                    </md>

                    so that the powers of <m>x</m> match in each sum.
                </p>

                <question>
                    <title>What is an index shift?</title>
                    
                    <p>
                        We bascially replace the index variable (which in the case of our sums is <m>n</m>) with something else.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since we want to match the powers of <m>x</m>, let's write <m>n = k+2</m> in the <em>first sum</em> above. That way, we'd have
                    </p>

                    <md>
                        <mrow>\sum_{n=0}^\infty n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2} \amp = \sum_{k+2=0}^\infty (k+2)(k+2-1)a_{k+2}x^{k+2-2} = \sum_{k=-2}^\infty (k+2) (k+1) a_{k+2} x^k.</mrow>
                    </md>

                    <p>
                        The <m>k = -2</m> is a little scary, but notice that <m>(k+2) (k+1) a_{k+2} x^k = 0</m> when <m>k = -2</m> and when <m>k = -1</m>. So, we can rewrite the sum as 
                    </p>

                    <md>
                        <mrow>\sum_{k=-2}^\infty (k+2) (k+1) a_{k+2} x^k \amp = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+2) (k+1) a_{k+2} x^k = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+2) (n+1) a_{n+2} x^n,</mrow>
                    </md>

                    <p>
                        where in the last step, we've just replaced all the <m>k</m>'s with <m>n</m>'s.
                    </p>
                </question>

                    This is usually enough to solve an exercise, since it can be difficult to find an explicit expression (no <m>a_{n+2}</m> or anything) for <m>a_n</m>.

                    Something very important to mention here though, is that only <em>even</em> terms depend on <em>even</em> terms, and only <em>odd</em> terms depend on <em>odd</em> terms.

                <p>
                    If we solve for <m>a_{n+2}</m> in <m>(n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2} + (2n+1)a_n = 0</m>, we get

                    So, <m>a_{n+2}</m> is proportional to <m>a_n</m>. Similarly, <m>a_n</m> is proportional to <m>a_{n-2}</m> and so on. At the very end, note that all <em>even</em> terms <m>a_{2k}</m> are proportional to <m>a_0</m> and all <em>odd</em> terms are proportional to <m>a_1</m>.

                    First things first, note that the point <m>x=1</m> is a regular singular point.

                    <p>
                        In this case we have <m>P(x) = x^2-1</m>, <m>Q(x) = 1</m>, and <m>R(x) = 1</m>. So, <m>q(x) = Q(x)/P(x) = 1/(x^2-1)</m> and <m>r(x) = R(x)/P(x) = 1/(x^2-1)</m>.

                    <p>
                        Note that <m>P(1) = 0</m>. The two limits we need to calculate unfold as follows:

                    <p>
                        Since these two limits are finite, <m>x=1</m> is a regular singular point.

                    Next, we observe the indicial equation: the root we want to use is <m>\lambda_1 = 1/2</m>.

                        From the previous question, we have that <m>q_0 = 1/2</m> and <m>r_0 = 0</m>. So, the indicial equation is

                    Before we continue, we should make things easier by using a substitution. Set <m>t = x-1</m> and <m>Y_1(t) = y_1(x)</m> and <m>Y(t) = y(x)</m>. This way, the ODE we need to solve is
